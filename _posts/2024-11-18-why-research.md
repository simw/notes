In today’s fast changing world, innovation is the route to success for many companies. Innovation often comes from successful research, and continued innovation is almost always the product of a systematic research process.

But what is ‘Research’ in this context? And how should a company, large or small, approach building a systematic research process?

### What is Research?

The term ‘Research’ is overloaded - including in customer research, market research, UX research and financial research. Here, I am referring to technical research in companies that have a technological, scientific or other technical component.

‘Research’ isn’t (just) a team or a job, although sometimes there are teams or people that specialize in doing research. Much more than that, ‘Research’ is a process, focused on answering technical questions which, at least initially, have unknown or uncertain solutions. These questions may even be ill defined, where the setting is ambiguous with no clear way to approach it. Research requires systematic investigation and usually some experimentation, first to fully define the problem and then to find the optimal solution.

This is in contrast with ‘Development’, which is usually defined as focused on implementing (mostly) known solutions. While there is no clear separation between the two (and an ideal implementation often blurs the lines even further), the concepts of research and development can be used to refer to two ends of a research-development continuum.

### Why do companies do research?

The first reason to do research is the most obvious: to improve existing products and create new ones. In a technical space, it may be that both revolutionary and incremental updates are non-obvious, and require answering ill defined questions with uncertain solutions. Without this, a development process may be unfocused or wasteful - although it is still often useful to launch both in parallel rather than series.

But there are more reasons to do research. Even if a company is happy not to launch new products in the near future, or has a sufficient development pipeline, it will likely want to know the risk of competitors jumping ahead. A research project can uncover these possibilities.

There are two other, linked reasons for research: prestige and the public good. Research that is released to the public can lead to increased prestige for the company. This prestige can then aid in fund raising or public relations, as well as recruitment or retention of staff. The best staff may want to alternate between frontier research projects and more mundane implementations. As well as the prestige of research, a company may want to contribute public research for altruistic reasons.

These different reasons for doing research may impact the approach and the products, and it is usually important to set this out at the inception of a project. For example, a product-development research project is likely to have more internal than external deliverables, in contrast to a prestige or public good driven project. 

### Principles of Research

While each technical area has its own specifics, there are some general principles that apply in many or most research projects:

#### 1. Collaboration makes research more productive

Research is sometimes seen as a task to be done in isolation, left to an individual and possibly a moment of inspiration. However, anything beyond a small, short term project or a very small team, collaboration between team members can significantly boost productivity. Even if just one person is the primary researcher, frequent opportunities for feedback can bring in wider perspective and more expertise. With more than one researcher, ‘pair researching’ can work well (depending on the researchers), or parallel work streams can be setup to start attacking different parts of the problem at once. Both can benefit significantly from planning ahead and breaking down larger pieces into smaller chunks.
#### 2. Research needs support and infrastructure

#### 3. Research and development should overlap as much as possible (when doing research for new and existing products)
