Research is a process focused on answering technical questions which, at least initially, have unknown or uncertain solutions. This is in contrast to development, which is usually focused on implementing (mostly) known solutions. While there is no clear separation between the two, it can be useful to place tasks somewhere between the two ends of the research-development continuum.

While many words have been spent on principles of optimal development, fewer have been spent on principles of optimal research. Research comes in many forms - from long-term, fundamental, academic research to short-term, applied, corporate work. The same principles may not apply across all forms, especially in cases where the approach has to work with the people, rather than the people with the approach. But principles may still be a useful reference point across the different forms.

Traditionally, research has been viewed as an individual, isolated task with intermittent formal collaboration. Researchers write lengthy documents (papers, specifications, etc.) and present them only when finished. However, this isn't the only approach, and it's often far from ideal. A more productive method can be called ‘Agile Research’, which abandons this individual approach and places collaboration and rapid iteration at its core. Drawing parallels to ‘Agile Software Development’, this concept can be further extended to ‘Extreme Research’, where each principal is taken to its extreme.

The principles presented here are far from new, but are rarely presented in this way.

### 1. Know your customer

Know them, speak with them, interact with them. 

Well defined scope

### 2. Collaborate constantly

Extreme Research: Pair researching

### 3. Automate everything (that you can)

Build infrastructure to make this and future projects more productive. Automation also provides reliability and tracability.

Less extreme: proportional investment

### 4. Outline rapidly, fill in later

Break the task down into smaller steps (knowing that the steps may be wrong).

Produce an outline of documentation, fill in and edit later

### 5. Implement while you research (Do while you think)

Don’t wait

Prototyping as experimentation

### 6. (Know when to) Take the tangent

Be ready to reevaluate.
